INTRODUCTION
============
This is my DREAM recorder(no gui). This will run as a daemon and depending upon
custom keyboard shortcut one can invoke/pause/stop the screencast.

Features (Proposed)
-------------------
* Keyboard shortcuts, always ready

* When stopped, it will remove noise using `sox` and remaster the video.

* Vocal intimations on every event(paused/recording/processing/stopped).

* Background upload to youtube with tags and other attributes.

* Will add few more here.
